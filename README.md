This was my first .NET MAUI project that implements various features (including SQLite and MVVM) for my final project for the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA).

The application breaks the difficulty levels into three separate categories (Basics, Intermediate, and Advanced). You can utilize CRUD operations to add new flashcards to the application based on the difficulty level.

For studying flashcards, I incorporated a simple layout that includes a 'turn' button, which utilizes a function to call a random flashcard filtered to a specific diffulty level from the SQLite database. You can turn the flashcard between the question and the answer as you choose, and move to the next random flashcard.

Although I created this application for turn-in as my final project for MSSA, I also wanted a useful tool to practice programming foundations for preparation to transition into the Tech industry.
